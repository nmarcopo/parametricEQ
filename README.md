# Addendum
I cannot thank enough my dad, [Vince Marcopoli](http://vince.marcopo.li), for his immense help with this project. He's always been a great role model for me in all aspects of my life. He's an electrical engineer by trade, and actually did his Master's thesis on something signal processing related while he was at Notre Dame! I'm glad I was able to work on something like this with him.

# Documentation
## TL;DR: Run DSPProject.m
You can find the instructions for using this project, along with all sorts of information on how signal processing techniques were used, in the `res` folder of the repo. Have fun playing around with it!
